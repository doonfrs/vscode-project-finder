## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Launch VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "Project Finder"
4. Click Install

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Before using Project Finder, you need to configure the folders where your projects are located:

1. Open VS Code Settings (File > Preferences > Settings)
2. Search for "Project Finder"
3. Add your project folders to the "Project Finder: Project Folders" setting

Example configuration:

```json
"projectFinder.projectFolders": [
  "C:\\Users\\YourName\\Projects",
  "D:\\Work\\Repositories",
  "D:\\Work\\Repositories/*"
]
```

For Linux/macOS:

```json
"projectFinder.projectFolders": [
  "/home/username/projects",
  "/var/www/html",
  "/opt/development/*"
]
```

> **Note:** There are two ways to specify project folders:
>
> 1. Regular path (e.g., `/home/username/projects`) - The folder itself will be added as a single project
> 2. Wildcard path (e.g., `/opt/development/*`) - All subfolders will be scanned and added as separate projects
>
> **Windows users:** Git Bash style paths are also supported (e.g., `/c/Users/YourName/Projects`).

## üéÆ Usage

### Custom UI (Default)

1. Press Shift+Space or Ctrl+Shift+Space anywhere in VS Code
2. Use the search box to filter projects
3. Click on a project to select it, or use arrow keys for navigation
4. Press Enter to open in the same window, or Shift+Enter to open in a new window
5. Toggle the "Open in New Window" switch to control window behavior
6. Click the star icon on any project to mark it as a favorite (favorites always appear at the top)

### Native Quick Pick UI

To enable the native VS Code Quick Pick UI:

1. Open VS Code Settings (File > Preferences > Settings)
2. Search for "Project Finder: Use Native UI"
3. Check the box to enable the native UI

Once enabled:

1. Press Shift+Space or Ctrl+Shift+Space anywhere in VS Code
2. Select a project from the dropdown list
3. Press Enter to open in the same window, or Shift+Enter to open in a new window
4. Alternatively, click the split-window button to toggle "New Window Mode"

## üí° Pro Tips

### Organize Your Projects Like a Pro

- **Development Hub**: Create a central development folder with `/*` wildcard

  ```json
  "projectFinder.projectFolders": ["/home/username/dev/*"]
  ```

- **Mixed Approach**: Combine specific projects with wildcard directories

  ```json
  "projectFinder.projectFolders": [
    "/home/username/dev/*",           // All projects in dev folder
    "/home/username/work/client-x",   // Specific client project
    "/var/www/html/*"                 // All web projects
  ]
  ```

- **Git Bash on Windows**: Use Unix-style paths for consistency across platforms

  ```json
  "projectFinder.projectFolders": [
    "/c/Users/YourName/Projects/*",
    "/d/work/repositories/*"
  ]
  ```

### Keyboard Ninja Workflow

1. Press `Shift+Space` to open Project Finder
2. Type a few characters to filter projects
3. Use arrow keys to navigate
4. Press `Enter` to open in same window
5. Hold `Shift` while pressing `Enter` to open in new window
6. Press `Alt+N` to toggle New Window Mode

## üß© How It Works

Project Finder scans the configured folders for valid projects. A folder is considered a valid project if it contains any of the following:

- .git directory
- package.json file
- .vscode directory
- pom.xml file
- build.gradle file
- Cargo.toml file
- go.mod file

The extension supports two ways to specify project folders:

1. Regular paths - The folder itself will be added as a single project
2. Wildcard paths (ending with `/*`) - All subfolders will be scanned and added as separate projects

On Windows, Git Bash style paths (e.g., `/c/Users/YourName/Projects`) are automatically converted to Windows paths (e.g., `C:/Users/YourName/Projects`).

Project Finder was built by developers who were tired of the friction in the standard VS Code workflow. We wanted something that felt like it should have been built into VS Code from the beginning.

## üßë‚Äçüíª For Development

### Building the Extension

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run watch` to compile in watch mode
4. Press F5 to launch the extension in debug mode

### Technical Notes

- The extension uses the modern `onStartupFinished` activation event, which is more efficient than the older command-based activation events
- VS Code 1.75.0+ automatically generates activation events based on contribution points, but the `vsce` packaging tool may still require an explicit `activationEvents` property
- The extension offers two UI options:
  - Quick Pick UI: Uses VS Code's native QuickPick API
  - Custom Popup Dialog: Uses WebView Panel with popup styling for a fully customizable interface
- The WebView HTML content is stored in a separate file for easier maintenance and customization
