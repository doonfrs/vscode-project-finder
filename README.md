## üöÄ The Missing Project Finder for VS Code

Ever felt frustrated trying to find that project you worked on last week? Tired of navigating through File > Open Folder every time?

**Project Finder** solves the problem VS Code never addressed - quick access to ALL your projects with just a keyboard shortcut!

- **Lightning Fast** - Access any project in milliseconds with Shift+Space
- **Smart Detection** - Automatically identifies real projects (no more digging through random folders)
- **Workflow Optimized** - Stay in your coding flow without interruptions
- **Cross-Platform** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux with the same experience

Stop wasting time hunting for projects and get back to what matters - writing great code!

## Features

- Quick access to your projects with simple keyboard shortcuts (Shift+Space or Ctrl+Shift+Space)
- Configurable list of project folders to search
- Automatic detection of valid projects (looks for .git, package.json, .vscode, etc.)
- Seamless integration with VS Code's folder opening functionality
- Open projects in the same window or a new window (using Shift+Enter)

## Installation

1. Launch VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "Project Finder"
4. Click Install

## Configuration

Before using Project Finder, you need to configure the folders where your projects are located:

1. Open VS Code Settings (File > Preferences > Settings)
2. Search for "Project Finder"
3. Add your project folders to the "Project Finder: Project Folders" setting

Example configuration:

```json
"projectFinder.projectFolders": [
  "C:\\Users\\YourName\\Projects",
  "D:\\Work\\Repositories",
  "D:\\Work\\Repositories/*"
]
```

For Linux/macOS:

```json
"projectFinder.projectFolders": [
  "/home/username/projects",
  "/var/www/html",
  "/opt/development/*"
]
```

> **Note:** There are two ways to specify project folders:
>
> 1. Regular path (e.g., `/home/username/projects`) - The folder itself will be added as a single project
> 2. Wildcard path (e.g., `/opt/development/*`) - All subfolders will be scanned and added as separate projects
>
> **Windows users:** Git Bash style paths are also supported (e.g., `/c/Users/YourName/Projects`).

## Usage

1. Press Shift+Space or Ctrl+Shift+Space anywhere in VS Code
2. Select a project from the dropdown list
3. Press Enter to open in the same window, or Shift+Enter to open in a new window
4. Alternatively, click the split-window button to toggle "New Window Mode"

## üí° Pro Tips

### Organize Your Projects Like a Pro

- **Development Hub**: Create a central development folder with `/*` wildcard
  ```json
  "projectFinder.projectFolders": ["/home/username/dev/*"]
  ```

- **Mixed Approach**: Combine specific projects with wildcard directories
  ```json
  "projectFinder.projectFolders": [
    "/home/username/dev/*",           // All projects in dev folder
    "/home/username/work/client-x",   // Specific client project
    "/var/www/html/*"                 // All web projects
  ]
  ```

- **Git Bash on Windows**: Use Unix-style paths for consistency across platforms
  ```json
  "projectFinder.projectFolders": [
    "/c/Users/YourName/Projects/*",
    "/d/work/repositories/*"
  ]
  ```

### Keyboard Ninja Workflow

1. Press `Shift+Space` to open Project Finder
2. Type a few characters to filter projects
3. Use arrow keys to navigate
4. Press `Enter` to open in same window
5. Hold `Shift` while pressing `Enter` to open in new window
6. Press `Alt+N` to toggle New Window Mode

## How It Works

Project Finder scans the configured folders for valid projects. A folder is considered a valid project if it contains any of the following:

- .git directory
- package.json file
- .vscode directory
- pom.xml file
- build.gradle file
- Cargo.toml file
- go.mod file

The extension supports two ways to specify project folders:

1. Regular paths - The folder itself will be added as a single project
2. Wildcard paths (ending with `/*`) - All subfolders will be scanned and added as separate projects

On Windows, Git Bash style paths (e.g., `/c/Users/YourName/Projects`) are automatically converted to Windows paths (e.g., `C:/Users/YourName/Projects`).
